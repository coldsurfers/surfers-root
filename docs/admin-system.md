# Admin System

- Tech stack
  - NextJS
  - Fastify
  - Prisma
  - GraphQL
- We use Apollo GraphQL for now, but we plan to switch to full-stack nextjs based api route for backend server and deal with DB
  - Because serverless is not suitable for complex backend
  - Especially for bundled files upload size limit
